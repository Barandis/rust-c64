# rust-c64
---

This is a hobby-level emulation of the Commodore 64 written in Rust. This project came about after fears that the JavaScript one (https://github.com/Barandis/c64) is just going to be too slow.

Currently, all of the JS is being ported to Rust. At that point, all of the devices will be complete except for the CPU (which I've emulated before and know my way around) and the last half of the VIC.
